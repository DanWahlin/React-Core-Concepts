# React Core Concepts

This project demonstrates core concepts of React development. The Angular version of the application can be found at https://github.com/danwahlin/angular-core-concepts.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find additional information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

Special thanks to [Damon Bauer](https://github.com/damonbauer) for the initial conversion of my Angular project to React!
